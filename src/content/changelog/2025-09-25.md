Today I added a set of interactive image gallery components to the component library. They're intended as reusable examples and building blocks for marketing pages and app UIs.

Highlights

- Five distinct, accessible gallery/lightbox patterns (examples included):
  - Centered lightbox with thumbnails
  - Sidebar thumbnail gallery
  - Horizontal carousel with dot indicators
  - Bottom-thumbnail layout with capped image height
  - Vertical carousel (stacked slides)
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation (Esc, ←, →, ↑, ↓), aria roles/labels, and sensible focus management.
- Responsive: mobile-first behavior with viewport-aware modals and thumbnail scrolling.
- The components use Alpine.js for lightbox state and transitions

See all examples in the [gallery page](/playground/marketing/gallery) from 16 to 20.
